# metarial-components


I tried to make a few examples of how we can override and use metarial design components in this application.

What is most needed is how we can use AutoComplete in general.
I created a class called AutoCompleteEntity and it works with this class. As an example,
I put user data and convert it to the entity I created by taking it.
